### Time Taken
2 hours

## Reflection
I found that task 2 and task 4 is hard for me as at first my code display the output after 1 second delay, not 1 second delay per task or number. I adjusted the code so the numbers and tasks will have different time before appearing to allow it to have 1 second delay in between, solving the challenge. I didn't do the extra miles as there are a lot of activities I've not done yet and I would exceed the estimated time if I tried to do it.
