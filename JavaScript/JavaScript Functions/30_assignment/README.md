## Time Taken and Reflection for Battle of the Warriors

### Time Taken
Around 3 hours or more

## Reflection
I did it around 3 hours or more as I have started this activity before Java course was given, so I'm not sure how long it took me exactly to finish aside from doing it today for around 3 hours. This took me some time as I need a while to recall JavaScript lessons and how my previous code works. Overall, I manage to do it and obtained the desired output.
