## Time Taken and Reflection for Working To-Do List

### Time Taken
1 hour 

## Reflection
The task was easy to do as I can use the To-do List activity before and the other 2 DOM activities as the basis for this activity. I only modified the HTML and CSS of the To-do List activity before so I don't need to start from scratch. I do also encountered a problem which was the onclick event when the submit button was clicked refreshed the page, preventing to get the proper output of the function but, through the use of .preventDefault() keyword function, which was provided in the tips, I am able to make it work. The only extra mile I did was preventing adding task when there is no task name inputted as I already did it in the Notification activity. I skipped the other extra miles so I can start working on the other activities in DOM manipulaton.
