## Time Taken and Reflection for Color Selector

### Time Taken
1 hour

## Reflection
Based on my understanding on what happened upon clicking the color buttons, if the event.stopPropagation() is commented, the container was also being clicked as shown through its alert message, and if the event.stopPropagation() is uncommented, it stops the container for also being clicked as the alert message for the container didn't pop up. To sum it up, it is useful to prevent unintended events when clicking child elements inside their container, in this case it prevent the the alert message event for the container also popping up when any of the color buttons was clicked.
