## Time Taken and Reflection for Notification

### Time Taken
1 hour and 30 minutes

## Reflection
I'm able to easily understand the activity. Being able to add the notifications to be displayed and allow it to be removed manually within the estimated time. The only thing I applied compared to what was taught in the module is when I used object.onclick = function() when I created the button to set its onclick attributes, allowing it to be manually deleted, which I've learned after I read about the .onclick keyword in the W3Schools JavaScript documentation. I didn't do the extra miles that makes the button disappear after some time as I don't want to add more minutes or hours that can exceed the estimated time.
