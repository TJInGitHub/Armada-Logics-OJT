## Time Taken and Reflection for Character Selection

### Time Taken
Around 6 hours or more

## Reflection
I'm unsure about the exact length of time it took me to finish the activity as there were parts that I took a break to charge my laptop. I added more time than the estimated time as I enjoyed doing the activity, especially that it's based on Fate: Grand Order, which I've played during my free times, and also, since I'm almost done with my OJT, I wanted to do extra miles to some activities I preferred or can do like this one. The challenges I faced include finding pictures I could use for the activity in which it took me an hour or two to compile it, setting the HTML page layout and CSS design, and the JavaScript codes to make it work as intended as I used 9 servants/characters to show with 3 images each (back of card, front card and main image). The design of page took me some time as I had a hard time positioning it to the way I wanted it to be. Because the original source image (back card image) will be replaced by the new image source (front card image) when a card is selected, I learned how to use .dataset keyword in a for each loop of servants to store each servant's original image source so I could recall it later to revert it back to it, which prevent the need to create variables for each servant that will store it. Overall, it's a fun activity and a good way to test our learnings in JavaScript DOM Manipulation.
