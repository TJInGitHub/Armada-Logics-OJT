## Time Taken and Reflection for Revisit Bank Account Manager

### Time Taken
1 hours and 30 minutes

## Reflection
I am able to complete it within the estimated time. What I do to achieve it within the estimated time was duplicate my notification function for displaying added notifications like daily withdrawal limit reached and can't exceed the withdrawal limit. For the transaction history, I just used document.createElement for the section tag to contain the transaction header and the transactions, h3 tag for the transaction header and p tag for the transactions. I also used style for their individual styling so I can achieve the intended output. I also completed faster as I just add 1 comment each for the creation of the transactions history for both withdrawal and deposit. I also plan to lessen my comments for the next activities as the number of comments I used also make it a challenge for me, as it makes my codes longer and a bit harder to look at.
