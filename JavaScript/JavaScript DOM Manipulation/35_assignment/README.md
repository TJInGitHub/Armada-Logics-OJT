## Time Taken and Reflection for Revisit Dynamic Profile Card Editor

### Time Taken
1 hour 

## Reflection
Completed within the estimated time as I only need to edit Dynamic Card Profile Editor activity to accomplish the task. I only need to change the html file to only have 1 single button to update everything about the profile card. For JavaScript, I removed other console.log and only have one of it to log that the profile card has been updated. I also included the alert function so the user can see that the profile card has been updated. I also did encounter some problems like the update was not working correctly after I changed the input type button to button, which I solved through the event.preventDefault() function, while the other problem was that when I'm editing the styling for the singular button, I didn't notice that I opened and updated the original html file compared to its copy for modification which is why I got confused for some minutes to why the style doesn't reflect on my display.
