## Time Taken and Reflection for Bank Account Manager

### Time Taken
3 hours

## Reflection
```I added 2 more hours to complete the activity. This was because I encountered problems in how I'm going to convert the obtained text content and value of an element into a float value for doing addition and subtraction operation to get the new balance (as upon obtaining, they are in string), including the output new balance being displayed is $NaN. I solved it after taking some time in which I used parseFloat() function to change the text content of an html element into a float value usable for mathematical operations, while for the current balance to be used for operation, I used the .replace("$", "") keyword alongside parseFloat() so the balance obtained will have the dollar sign removed allowing the parseFloat() function to convert it in a workable float value. After solving these problem, I'm also able to solved the new balance output to display correctly instead of $NaN. After solving those issue (which already took long enough to know), I already plan to submit it but after taking another look in the sample, I forgot to include the notification to be displayed that can be seen by users so I work on it, which is why I added more time to accomplish the activity.```
