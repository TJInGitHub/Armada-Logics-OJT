## Time Taken and Reflection for Character Builder

### Time Taken
3 hours

## Reflection
Able to do it within the estimated time. I'm also able to do the extra miles in which I demonstrated locking in to the character by removing the selection of armor pieces and button that confirms the selection (as it shows that its final), in which there's also an alert message that tells that the character was created to the user and the details of the armor piece chosen will be displayed in the alert message. My only challenge was the number of armor pieces that I have to work with, as I feel like its too many, but once it's set-up in the HTML file, the JavaScript program will be much easier to complete.
