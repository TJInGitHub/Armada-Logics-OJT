## Time Taken and Reflection for Jack-in-the-Box

### Time Taken
1 hour and 10 minutes

## Reflection
The activity was easy and I added an animation through making the image change to gif upon opening. The challenge I encountered was in doing the extra mile of adding a sound effect as after taking some time to learn how to put it, I failed multiple times. I stopped after realizing that I exceed the estimated time by 10 minutes so I didn't add that functionality.
