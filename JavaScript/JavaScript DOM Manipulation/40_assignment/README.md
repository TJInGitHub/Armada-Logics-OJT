## Time Taken and Reflection for Catching the Fireflies

### Time Taken
1 hour

## Reflection
Because the code was already provided, I can do it within the estimated time. The only challenge that I have encountered was making the size of the firefly shrink bit by bit after clicking and return to its original size too, by growing bit by bit after 1 second. To solve this, I learned the use of setInterval() function that executes lines of codes based on the time provided (i.e. it executes the line of codes every 5 seconds). Through this, I manage to make it shrink by 0.1 until the firefly scale reach 0 and hiding it once clicked, and after a second (through setTimeout()), make it visible again and use the setInterval() function too to return to its original size after 1 second by growing its scale by 0.1 until it reaches a scale of 1 again.
