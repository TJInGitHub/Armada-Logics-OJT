## Time Taken and Reflection for Revisit Color Selector

### Time Taken
1 hour

## Reflection
The activity was easy as I only need to add some changes like new colors, selected color display and to allow the background of the body to change. The challenges that I encounter was how the selected color text and color changes in displayed text will be done and removing the border for each color buttons that were not clicked. I solved this by combining document.querySelector alongside for each loop for button elements that uses .colorbox CSS selector which is initiated at the start of the function when the container or any button was clicked so the border can be removed for the other buttons not clicked. For the color changes in text, I used if-else-if statement that use conditions based on rgb color value of the background color, so the selected color text applied will change its text content based on the current color and to the colors of the following text like the title, description and the selected color text change to white or black depending on the rgb color value of the background color.
