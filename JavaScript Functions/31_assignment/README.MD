## Reflection
Added an extra 1 hour and 30 minutes due to fixing errors caused by creating new character object. At first, I wanted to only use the character object as the template to make the object although I encountered errors with regards to declaring the changes in its properties. The possible solution I've read is using Object.create to make a copy of the character object although, I think it's not in the module so I try to find other way. I solved it by creating another object with the same properties to be the template for the new character objects, while still using methods and functions connected to the character object through referencing. Other problems include forgetting to initialize variables and the for loop for verifying and changing the object's name if its similar to another object's name in the same party, leading to errors which I've fixed. Overall, this activity allow me to remember and learn more in handling objects in JavaScript.
