## Time Taken and Reflection for Netflix (Responsive)

### Time Taken
Around 8 hours or more

## Reflection
This activity was really tough for me as the phone size was not given. Additionally, there were times that the responsive stylying I've put doesn't reflect (i.e. sometimes I forgot to make it specific or the values I put didn't make much difference like changing the size in percentage). This made me took much longer and lost track of time (though I know I am able to do around 8 hours as I continued working on it until I complete it.). I solved the problems by adjusting the sizing through rem (for containers) or percentage to make it work. For the sizing like fonts, I searched for ideal sizing range for desktop, tablets and phones as basis for the sizing I would use.
