## Reflection
I started yesterday and was unable to finish it due to having a tough time adjusting containers as when I adjusted a container like a section or the main tag, others elements were also adjusting to it. I managed to solve it although I can say that it's not that perfect especially when the accompanying images in position relative may cover a bit of the description in desktop screen responsiveness.
