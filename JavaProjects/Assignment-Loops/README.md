## Time Taken and Reflection for Assignment: Loops

### Time Taken
2 hours and 20 minutes

## Reflection
The Task 1: Multiplication Table Generator and Task 2: Sum of Natural Numbers were easy for me as I don't need to think over it a lot, accomplishing it in 10 minutes each. For Task 3: Password Checker, it took me 1 hour longer than the estimated time as I'm unsure to how I'm going to compare the inputted password to the correct password as both are strings, in which I've learned that standard logical operators like (>, <, etc.) can't be used for strings upon searching. I've learned in W3Schools that I can use the String method *.equals*, but because it's not in the module, I've still think of another way I can do the program without it. I accomplished it by having the idea of using switch statements alongside the do while loop. For Task 4: Find the Largest Number, I took 30 minutes (adding 10 minutes from the estimated time) as I needed to fix the if-else-if statement I included in the do while loop to make it work. Lastly, I accomplished Task 5: Number Guessing Game in 30 minutes (within the provided estimated time), with the same reason of fixing the if-else-if statement, which is instead included in while loop.
