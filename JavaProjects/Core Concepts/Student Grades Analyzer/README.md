## Time Taken and Reflection for Number System Converter - Part1

### Time Taken
1 hour

## Reflection
Added another 15 minutes to finished the activity compared to the estimated time to ensure that the output is correct. My approach is doing an output for the following each (from totalGrades to lowestGrade) and then made modifications to it on the last one as I've realized that I can just use one for each loop to get all of the output.
