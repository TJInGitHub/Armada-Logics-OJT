## Time Taken and Reflection for Number System Converter - Part1

### Time Taken
2 hours 

## Reflection
The task needed me to took another hour as I'm having a hard time thinking of a way how I can program it to ouput it in binary, octal and hexadecimal, including that I should've finished this activity last Friday but unable to as a blue screen of death (BSOD) appeared in my laptop msking me stop to work on the activity on that day. Today, my laptop is now working fine and by checking through documentations and guides on the internet like in StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks, I'm able to finish the activity.
