## Time Taken and Reflection for Secure Banking System

### Time Taken
9 hours

## Reflection
I've got a lot of problems that I've encountered in this activity, making me unable to finish it yesterday. The first thing was that upon seeing the estimated time of 1.5 hrs, I know that I couldn't complete it in that said amount of time. Now the main problems that I've encountered was in creating the object. I thought at first that it was similar to how I created objects when they are public, although it's not as I need to create an object (with the default constructor) first before setting its real attribute to the setter methods. Additionally, I created an object at first inside the while loop, leading to errors that the object's attributes not being saved and it also includes variables that I declared inside do while loops and if statements so I put it outside to make it work. Other issues include how I'm going to check if the account number are formed by number digits and has a lenght of 10, which I've solved by learning and applying .matches keyword with regex pattern "\\d{10}" so it can check for matches of digits and considers a length of 10. There are many more errors like in error handlings which I've tried to solve individually. But, due to exceeding too much with regards to time, I will stop perfecting the program as I've also managed to get the program to output the example. I also do trial test and I think the error handlings are working fine (excluding the part if choice 3 is picked for deposit as it still listed a deposit transaction of 0 amount). Overall, this activity made me learn how to use other java keywords to achieve the desired output.
