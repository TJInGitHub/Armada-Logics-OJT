## Time Taken and Reflection for Employee Payroll Management System

### Time Taken
4 hours

## Reflection
Completed it in 4 hours although have yet to add some comments to other parts, add other program outputs and recheck if there are output errors that I might have missed after running a number of tests. What makes me took longer is that I try to create 2 classes this time to make it similar to how my instructors do it, which are the Employee class to create the employee objects and the EmployeePayrollManagementSystem class that serves as the primary class of the file to where the main method to execute the program is included, which is different to what I used to make (my previous activities about OOP only used 1 class (the primary class) to where I also declare the constructors). I faced errors that I have solved like improper declaration of constructor as I put it at first outside the class and incorrect loops as it makes the program declare all objects despite looping. Thanks to my previous activity, I learned how to solve the following. I will submit this for the mean time to show my progress (which I should have submitted before a new day started, to really show that I did it in the exact amount of time). Will submit the final file that is fully commented and verified by myself completely that there were no errors left.
