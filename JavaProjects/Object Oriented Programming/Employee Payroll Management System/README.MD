## Time Taken and Reflection for Employee Payroll Management System

### Time Taken
5 hours

## Reflection
Completed it in 4 hours yesterday, but added 1 hour today this early morning to fix a few errors I have verified, add comments to other functionalities and include possible outputs as comments too. What makes me took longer is that I try to create 2 classes this time to make it similar to how my instructors do it, which are the Employee class to create the employee objects and the EmployeePayrollManagementSystem class that serves as the primary class of the file to where the main method to execute the program is included, which is different to what I used to make (my previous activities about OOP only used 1 class (the primary class) to where I also declare the constructors and the main method). I faced errors that I have solved like improper declaration of constructor as I put it at first outside the class and incorrect loops as it makes the program declare all objects despite looping. Thanks to my previous activity, I learned how to solve the following.
