## Time Taken and Reflection for Student Grade Manager

### Time Taken
4 hours

## Reflection
Took me 4 times the estimated time as I'm getting confused to how I'm going to show static methods, instance methods and overload methods individually, including how I am going to put the inputted grades in the array. I did this yesterday, although stopped after 2 hours due to no idea coming up to my mind even after doing research on the net. I resumed today, trying to do it one by one, while also researching again on the net. I'm able to accomplish this after another 2 hours, although made modifications to show the following methods. For static, I made the user to input a choice indicating if the student is overloading or not. For instance methods, it includes void method to display student details, method to calculate average and method to classify the grade average. For overload methods, I sustituted it to overload object constructors where the other one accept 3 grades and the other one accept 4 grades (this idea came up after learning about it in today's morning meeting session).
