## Time Taken and Reflection for Student Management System

### Time Taken
7 hours

## Reflection
At first, I thought that I could do it easily, so I tried to experiment in code declarations for methods, constructors and classes to know if I can make it work based on my idea. After figuring that some may work while others may not, I proceed in making the program received user inputs to create objects. The problem with this, which made me took much longer to finish was that I'm unable to figure out a way for it to handle multiple object creations. I worked on it yesterday and already have 4 times the length of estimated time due to trying to research a way that I can do it, while also ensuring that I've also understand and didn't go beyond advance concepts (like importing other modules). I solved the problem with creating multiple objects by creating an array to store them although stopped for the mean time as it's getting late. Continuing today, I managed to finish it after another 3 hours, solving problems when it comes to displaying the objects created if they are stored in the array, updating the objects stored in the array (which my solution is almost similar to displaying it and calling object attributes like in javascript after remembering it and finding out that it can be coded almost the same in java) and adding error handlings, like if there are no student records yet and if there are no existing students with the same id inputted when updating. Overall, it gave me knowledge and experience to solve this kind of problems in the future as I'm able to learn what I've not known yet despite taking too much time.
