## Time Taken and Reflection for Student Management System

### Time Taken
4 hours

## Reflection
At first, I thought that I could do it easily, so I tried to experiment in code declarations for methods, constructors and classes to know if I can make it work based on my idea. After figuring that some may work while others may not, I proceed in making the program received user inputs to create objects. The problem with this, which made me took much longer to finish was that I'm unable to figure out a way for it to handle multiple object creations. I'm now 4 times the length of estimated time due to trying to research a way that I can do it, while also ensuring that I've also understand and didn't go beyond advance concepts (like importing other modules). Because I think I have figured it out, I'll be continuing it tomorrow as I will now figure out a way to handle objects inside an array instead.
