## Time Taken and Reflection for Assignment: Conditional Statements

### Time Taken
2 hours and 50 minutes

## Reflection
Odd and Even Checker (Task 1) and Grading System (Task 2) are both easy as I also tried to do the exercises in the lesson about it, allowing me to only modified it to meet the requirements. The Electricity Bill (Task 3) took me an hour as I need to put my explanation to how the formula works in comments, while also making it an if-else-if statement than if-else only because I also wanted to give a separate output to units less than or equal to 100, and also units less than 300 and higher than 100. For Rock, Paper, Scissors (Task 4), it almost took me 2 hours due to the need to put comments to explain how it works that can be understand easily and because I'm conflicted with my decision to how I'm going to make it only by using a switch statement that are not too many (as my first idea includes many of it). In the end, I'm able to think of a way that only used 2 switch statements to accomplish the task.
